Final Project for ECE695

build using our make file.

To run:

graph: 4 command line arguments: # nodes, # connections, RNG Seed (9 digits), #Graphs to generate
attackSim: # of Start graph, # end graph, graph directory, result file, # nodes

Notes:

graph creates a Graphs directory with files graph0.txt to graph#.txt.  The number in these file names is what the 1st and 2nd argument to attackSim refers to.

the #nodes argument to attackSim is the maximum node # to use as a starting point.
