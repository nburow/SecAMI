Initialization done, start attack
At 0.100000 second comes event 0
node 6 is compromised
2.000000 second later hop to 4
8.100000 second should be detected
At 2.100000 second comes event 2
reach node: 4
3.000000 second later compromise node 4
At 5.100000 second comes event 0
node 4 is compromised
2.000000 second later hop to 2
2.000000 second later hop to 7
11.100000 second should be detected
At 7.100000 second comes event 2
reach node: 7
3.000000 second later compromise node 7
At 7.100000 second comes event 2
reach node: 2
3.000000 second later compromise node 2
At 8.100000 second comes event 1
node: 6 is detected
disconnect its neighbour:
4 7 
disconnect 4 from 6
disconnect 6 from 4
disconnect 7 from 6
disconnect 6 from 7
stop attacking from node 6 to node 7
Now the graph is like:
nodes: 8
0 1 
1 0 2 
2 1 3 4 5 
3 2 7 
4 2 
5 2 
6 
7 3 
--------------------------------------------
At 10.100000 second comes event 0
node 2 is compromised
2.000000 second later hop to 1
All of the neighbours are COMPROMISED
14.100000 second should be detected
Event has been cancelled, delete from the heap
At 11.100000 second comes event 1
node: 4 is detected
disconnect its neighbour:
2 
disconnect 2 from 4
disconnect 4 from 2
Now the graph is like:
nodes: 8
0 1 
1 0 2 
2 1 3 5 
3 2 7 
4 
5 2 
6 
7 3 
--------------------------------------------
At 12.100000 second comes event 2
reach node: 1
3.000000 second later compromise node 1
At 14.100000 second comes event 1
node: 2 is detected
disconnect its neighbour:
1 3 5 
disconnect 1 from 2
disconnect 2 from 1
disconnect 3 from 2
disconnect 2 from 3
disconnect 5 from 2
disconnect 2 from 5
stop attacking from node 2 to node 1
Now the graph is like:
nodes: 8
0 1 
1 0
